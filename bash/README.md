# My Bash Configuration

Instead of cramping my whole configuration into one single file (.bashrc), I
use three different files:

- settings
- aliases
- functions

They are located in '.bash/' and sourced by .bashrc in that order.

Important environment variables are set in .bash_profile, which also sources
.bashrc.

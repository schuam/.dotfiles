This repository contains my personal dotfiles. Feel free to use them if you
like them.

There is a script to install the dotfiles (make symlinks where they belong).\
**WARNING**: Before you run the scipt, read it, understand what it does, and
make sure you want it to do what it does.

I added a new python installation script. This has not been used or tested, so
don't use it, without checking the code before you run it.


# TODO

- Update installation script, it is not quite up to date.
- Test the python installation script.
- Find an overall better solution to install my dotfiles.

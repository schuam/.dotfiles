# Read about the gemrc format at http://guides.rubygems.org/command-reference/#gem-environment

# --user-install is used to install to $HOME/.gem/ by default since we want to separate
#                pacman installed gems and gem installed gems

# I don't want user installed gems to ent up in .gem. I set up a different
# location for that.
# gem: --user-install

# Read about the gemrc format at http://guides.rubygems.org/command-reference/#gem-environment

# --user-install is used to install to $HOME/.gem/ by default since we want to separate
#                pacman installed gems and gem installed gems

# I don't want user installed gems to end up in $HOME/.gem. I set up a
# different location for that with the environment variables GEM_HOME, GEM_PATH
# and GEM_SPEC_CACHE which I set in my .bash_profile. Therefore I commented out
# the following line:

# gem: --user-install
